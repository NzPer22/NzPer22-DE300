We made our best efforts to complete this project independently, including designing workflows, writing code, and troubleshooting any issues that arose. Generative AI tools were later utilized to address specific technical challenges, including Airflow scheduling, AWS integration, and data formatting. These tools helped streamline our process, but all code, decisions, and final outputs were reviewed, validated, and refined by our team.
